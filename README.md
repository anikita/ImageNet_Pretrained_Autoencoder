# ImageNet Pretrained Autoencoder
An ImageNet pretrained autoencoder using Keras. 
I use a VGG16 net pretrained on Imagenet to build the encoder. The rest of the network is trained in a toy Imagenet dataset.
The example shows that the convergence is fast up to a certain point considering the small size of the training dataset.
